              <p class="align-left"><em>Sunday in the Park with George</em> is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine. It was inspired by the French pointillist painter Georges Seurat's painting <em>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</em>. The plot revolves around George, a fictionalized version of Seurat, who immerses himself deeply in painting his masterpiece, and his great-grandson (also named George), a conflicted and cynical contemporary artist. The Broadway production opened in 1984.

The bold lines, almost scribbles, that compose the figures are stark against a plain, white background. Though the two figures seem to be standing still, the drawing is full of movement; the lines are exuberant and the overall effect is catchy and one of bright humor.

                <strong>Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) | 1972</strong>
                <br>David Hockney
                <br>Private Collection
              </p>
              <p class="align-left">Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) represents a culminating apex of two of the artist’s most celebrated motifs — the pool and the double portrait.

              <p class="align-left">Often autobiographical — dealing with need, rejection and intimacy — Hockney’s depictions of his friends and lovers are among the strongest in his oeuvre. Chief among his aggregation of muses is the standing figure in <em>Portrait of an Artist</em>, Peter Schlesinger. Hockney met the eighteen-year-old Schlesinger in 1966 while he was a student in one of Hockney’s advanced art classes at UCLA. For the next five years, Schlesinger would prove to be the great love of Hockney’s life, as well as a favorite muse.

              <p class="align-left">The two lived together in California and London, mixing with Hockney’s expansive social circle as a prominent couple in the world of art, film and literature. Throughout the late 1960s as their relationship deepened, Hockney’s desire to capture the intensity of his feelings for Peter, as well as his physical beauty, contributed greatly to the artist’s sudden shift towards a more naturalistic approach to his work. However, the much younger Schlesinger was far less gregarious than Hockney, and tensions between the pair grew gradually before a heated fight in Cadaqués in 1971 led to the end of their relationship — leaving Hockney distraught.

              <p class="align-left">Although Schlesinger had successfully completed his training as an artist by the time Hockney completed <em>Portrait of an Artist</em>, Hockney has included no indication that Schlesinger is the artist referred to in the title. Thus, it has often been suggested that the artist is Hockney himself, represented metonymically by the artist’s most iconic motif — the image of the pool. In this work, Hockney acknowledges the shift in tone in his relationship with Schlesinger, the emotional distance that was separating them from each other.

              <p class="align-left">The standing man, conspicuously clothed, leans over the edge of the pool to gaze at an amoebic figure swimming under water, adrift in a beautiful yet alien realm. In contrast to the evident naturalism of the surrounding landscape, the rendering of the pool and swimmer is carefully patterned, highly artificial, contextually abstracted. It is as if the standing man is staring deep into a perfect picture, thoroughly seduced yet fully aware of its utter inaccessibility. The picture is a portrait of an artist — but it is a portrait of a spectator too.

              </p>
              <p class="align-left">At the height and end of his "Golden Period," Gustav Klimt painted his most famous picture: a couple in love in a flowery meadow.The male, dressed in a geometrically patterned robe and wearing a vine crown on his head, clutches the lady’s face as he moves in to kiss her. The female figure has flowers in her hair and wears a colorful, naturally patterned outfit that contrasts with her partner’s. Klimt surrounds the couple with a golden halo and takes them away from reality. His "kiss" thus becomes a timeless, universal symbol of love. The interplay between the natural depiction of faces and hands and the ornamental resolution on a golden background makes the painting shine like a precious piece of jewelry.

              <p class="align-left">Madame Pierre Gautreau (the Louisiana-born Virginie Amélie Avegno; 1859–1915) was known in Paris for her artful appearance. Sargent hoped to enhance his reputation by painting and exhibiting her portrait. Working without a commission but with his sitter’s complicity, he emphasized her daring personal style, showing the right strap of her gown slipping from her shoulder. At the Salon of 1884, the portrait received more ridicule than praise. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap and kept the work for over thirty years. When, eventually, he sold it to the Metropolitan, he commented, “I suppose it is the best thing I have done,” but asked that the Museum disguise the sitter’s name.</p>

              <p class="align-left">One of the most sought-after painters of his era, Sargent achieved considerable critical and financial success portraying cosmopolitan members of high society on both sides of the Atlantic. Here, the artist depicts an acquaintance—a relative of the Colt firearms family—who had recently married his distant cousin Ralph. In her portrait, Curtis wears an elegant satin dress and poses as if she were welcoming guests into her palatial Venetian home. The painting apparently was a wedding gift to the couple by the artist; its inscription at the top right reads, "To Ralph and Mrs. Ralph, John S. Sargent 1898."</p>

              <p class="align-left">Manet summered at Gennevilliers in 1874, often spending time with Monet and Renoir across the Seine at Argenteuil, where Boating was painted. Beyond adopting the lighter touch and palette of his younger Impressionist colleagues, Manet exploits the broad planes of color and strong diagonals of Japanese prints to give inimitable form to this scene of outdoor leisure. Rodolphe Leenhoff, the artist’s brother-in-law, is thought to have posed for the sailor but the identity of the woman is uncertain.
              <p class="align-left">Shown in the Salon of 1879, Boating was deemed "the last word in painting" by Mary Cassatt, who recommended the acquisition to the New York collectors Louisine and H.O. Havemeyer.

              </p>
              <p class="align-left">This complex intersection, just minutes away from the Saint-Lazare train station, represents in microcosm the changing urban milieu of late nineteenth-century Paris. Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte</em>, painted less than a decade later.

              </p>
              <p class="align-left"><em>Las Meninas</em> (the ladies-in-waiting) is a 1656 painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. It has become one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting, due to the way its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and the unceertain relationship it creates between the viewer and the figures depicted.

              <p class="align-left">The painting depicts a room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid during the reign of King Philip IV of Spain. Some of the figures look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The five-year-old Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand.

              <p class="align-left">In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer.

The film tells the story of Chihiro Ogino, a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, enters the world of Kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore). <em>Spirited Away</em> is regarded as Miyazaki's magnum opus.

              <p class="align-left">It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, making it the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the award.

                <strong>The Windmill of Wijk bij Duurstede | c. 1670</strong>

                <br>Amsterdam Museum
              </p>
              <p class="align-left">The painting shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometers from Utrecht, with a dominating cylindrical windmill, harmonised by the lines of river bank and sails, and the contrasts between light and shadow working together with the intensified concentration of mass and space. The attention to detail is remarkable. Art historian Seymour Slive reports that both from an aeronautical engineering and a hydrological viewpoint the finest levels of details are correct, in the windmill's sails and the river's waves respectively.

              <p class="align-left">Ruisdael's windmill no longer stands, although its foundations can still be seen.

              <p class="align-left">While staying in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26257743">landboat in Ballinspittle</a>, our Airbnb host, Dawna, recommended we drive up to the Old Head of Kinsale. With not much else to do in the small town, we took her advice and were rewarded with this view — which honestly, we thought was more impressive than the Cliffs of Moher, with the added bonus of having the view practically all to ourselves!

             <p class="align-left"> The Knight of Cups is part of what tarot card readers call the Minor Arcana (the suit cards).

               <p class="align-left">If the card is upright, it represents change and new excitements, particularly of a romantic nature. It can mean invitations, opportunities and offers. The Knight of Cups is a person who is a bringer of ideas, opportunities and offers. He is constantly bored and in constant need of stimulation, but also artistic and refined. He represents a person who is amiable, intelligent and full of high principles.

              <p class="align-left">This poster was created for a one-man Chagall exhibition at the Maeght Gallery in Paris.
              <p class="align-left">Chagall’s dreamlike compositions depict aspects of the artist’s personal and family histories, and those of Eastern European folklore at large. Flying figures, elements of Jewish tradition, peasant life and animals are frequent motifs.
              <p class="align-left">“When I am finishing a picture, I hold some God-made object up to it — a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand as a final test,” he said. “If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make, the painting is authentic. If there’s a clash between the two, it’s bad art.”
